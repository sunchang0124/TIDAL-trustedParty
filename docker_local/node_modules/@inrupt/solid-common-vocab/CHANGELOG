# Changelog

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.5.3

### Internal refactor

- Replaced `@rdfjs/data-model` with `rdf-data-factory` (as it provides full
TypeScript compatibility with the RDF/JS DataFactory type).
- Only require RDF/JS implementation as a Dev dependency as opposed to a full
dependency (meaning users of this library are completely free to depend on
whatever implementation they choose).

## 0.5.2

### Patches

- Export useful RDF/JS types directly.

## 0.4.2

### Patches

- Fixed the license SPDX in `package.json`.
